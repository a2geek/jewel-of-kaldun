# Jewel of Kaldun

## Notes
* `Makefile` is very rudimentary as I am not a Makefile type person and build is so fast it doesn't matter
* Pay attention to versions
* `Makefile` makes assumptions about where things are placed, correct as necessary

## Current setup(s)

### Windows

> Please note that this mixes the Cygin Unix-y path flavor with the Windows path flavor.  Java (as it is a Windows application) requires Windows pathing instead of Unix pathing.  See the `Makefile` configuration section.

* Cygwin 64-bit
 * git
 * gcc (to compile Merlin32)
 * make
* Java (Windows version)
* AppleCommander 
* Merlin32

## Software required to build:
* [Merlin32](http://www.brutaldeluxe.fr/products/crossdevtools/merlin/index.html) by Brutal Deluxe (version 1.0)
* The command-line variant of [AppleCommander](https://sites.google.com/site/drjohnbmatthews/applecommander) (please note this project is using 1.3.5.14-ac and that the command-line options do vary across versions)
* Either a real Apple II or an emulator
